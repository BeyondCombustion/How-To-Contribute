# Want To Contribute?

This GitHub is a placeholder for a future project to supplement the /r/vaporents subreddit which is already in the works.

In the menatime, we'd like to build a collection of other communities and information to share.

If you know how to use GitHub, [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)! :-)

If not, no big deal, send us an email at admin@beyondcombustion.net with your suggestion for the project and we'll get it added.
